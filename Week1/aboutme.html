            Hello! My name is <b>Eustina Kim</b> and I am a senior at UCLA majoring in Statistics and minoring in Digital Humanities. I'm very excited to take DH151 because it covers many topics that I've wanted to learn before. 
            For instance, I've been wanting to make a portfolio website or a blog showcasing my data analysis projects but I gave up on it because I didn't know how to work with html/css. 
            But if you are on this website, it means that now I know how to :). I'm also looking forward to learn how to make cool web maps because I've definitely struggled on it in the past. 
            Few months ago, I was supposed to make a map of businesses that opened and closed in Westwood to be embedded part of a Daily Bruin article but I ended up using R instead of html/css because I was more familiar with R as a statistician. 
            If you want to check out the article, click <a href="https://stack.dailybruin.com/2021/02/16/westwood-business-turnover/">here</a>.
            Overall, I think taking this class will give me more tools to work with when I'm visualizing data!
